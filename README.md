## Introduction

I received a PhD in the field of Internet of Things from Coventry University, UK for my work on Application Deployment 
Optimisation in heterogeneous Fog Computing environments. My current work on HEED and EnergyREV focuses on the digital architecture of Energy Systems
and achieving their full potential through cyber-physical components with special interest in forecasting and optimisation. My research interests 
include Wireless Sensor Networks; Internet of Things; Smart Local Energy Systems; Cloud and Fog Computing.
